AI Log Analyzer — Architecture Spec (MVP)
0) Top-Level Intent

A multi-tenant SaaS that ingests application logs, summarizes issues with an LLM, detects anomalies, and sends actionable alerts. Priorities: simplicity, low friction ingestion, clear summaries, affordable costs.

1) Component Inventory 

[C1] Log Sources

Apps, servers, containers, CI jobs

Emit JSON/NDJSON/text logs; optionally gzip

Optional lightweight uploader/CLI or direct HTTP upload

[C2] Edge & Ingress

CloudFront (static + TLS) → ALB/Ingress (HTTPS :443)

WAF rules for basic protection (rate limit, IP allowlists)

[C3] Auth Service

Auth0 (MVP) issuing JWT/OIDC ID tokens

Roles: owner, admin, member, viewer

Tenancy claims: org_id, plan, quota

[C4] API Gateway / FastAPI App

Endpoints for auth callback, pre-signed uploads, streaming logs, job creation, search, summaries, alerts mgmt

Validates JWT, enforces quotas & RLS guardrails

Issues S3 pre-signed PUT URLs

Publishes SQS jobs for processing

[S1] Object Storage

S3 buckets (encrypted SSE-S3/SSE-KMS)

Prefixing: org_id/source_id/yyyy/mm/dd/...

Lifecycle: raw logs → 30–90 days (configurable)

[S2] Metadata DB

RDS Postgres (TLS, encryption at rest)

Tables: org, user, source, upload, chunk, summary, anomaly, alert_rule, alert_event, api_key

Optional: pgvector for embeddings (chunk_embedding)

[Q1] Work Queue

SQS (fifo not required for MVP)

Message types: INGESTED_FILE, STREAM_WINDOW, SUMMARIZE, ANALYZE

[C5] Workers (Processing Pipelines)

Python workers (Celery/RQ) on Fargate/ECS

Stages: parse → chunk → stats → anomaly → embedding (optional) → summarize → persist

Batches logs to reduce LLM cost (token-aware chunking)

[C6] AI Service

Abstraction over LLMs (OpenAI or local Llama via vLLM)

Prompt templates & cost/rate limits

Caching (Redis) of identical prompts/chunks

Safety: PII scrubber (email/IP/token patterns) before sending to LLM

[C7] Notification Service

Slack webhooks, Email (SES), (Teams later)

Dedup, throttle, and escalation policies

Alert templates include summary + top lines + link to dashboard view

[C8] Web Dashboard

Next.js + Tailwind (SSR/SSG where sensible)

Auth via Auth0

Views: uploads, sources, summaries, anomalies, alert rules, billing/usage

Client calls API for lists/details; server renders

[S3] Observability

Metrics: Prometheus (managed) → Grafana

Traces: OpenTelemetry → OTLP collector → managed backend

Internal logs: shipped to CloudWatch/Loki (dogfooding possible)

2) Networking & Ports

External: HTTPS :443 → [C2] → [C4]/[C8]

Internal:

[C4] ↔ [S1] (S3 SDK), [S2] (5432), [Q1] (HTTPS), [C7] (HTTPS), [C6] (HTTPS or VPC endpoint)

[C5] ↔ [S1]/[S2]/[Q1]/[C6]

All egress restricted via NAT + VPC endpoints (S3, SQS, Secrets Manager)

3) API (v1) — Key Endpoints (JWT required unless noted)

POST /v1/auth/callback (public redirect)

POST /v1/sources create a source (name, env, parser hints)

POST /v1/logs/upload-url → {url, fields, object_key}

POST /v1/logs/register-upload body: {object_key, size, hash, source_id}

POST /v1/logs/stream NDJSON or text (optional gzip); headers: X-Org-Id, X-Source-Id

GET /v1/summaries?source_id&since&until&limit

GET /v1/anomalies?source_id&since&until

POST /v1/alert-rules (conditions & channels)

GET /v1/usage (bytes, requests, quota)

POST /v1/api-keys (scoped to org or source, rate-limited)

Preferred upload flow (cheap & scalable):

upload-url → client PUTs to S3 directly

register-upload → creates upload row + SQS job

4) Data Model (high-level)

org(id, name, plan, created_at)

user(id, org_id, email, role, auth0_sub)

source(id, org_id, name, env, parser_hint, created_at)

upload(id, org_id, source_id, object_key, size, hash, status, created_at)

chunk(id, upload_id, org_id, offset, length, ts_start, ts_end, line_count)

summary(id, org_id, source_id, chunk_id, severity, title, bullets[], llm_model, cost_usd, created_at)

anomaly(id, org_id, source_id, ts_window, metric, observed, baseline, zscore, label, created_at)

alert_rule(id, org_id, source_id, condition_json, channels_json, is_active)

alert_event(id, org_id, rule_id, status, first_seen, last_sent, count, payload_json)

api_key(id, org_id, name, scopes[], hash, created_at)

RLS approach (MVP): every table has org_id; all queries parameterized; integration tests ensure org leakage doesn’t happen.

5) Processing & AI Pipelines

Parsing/Chunking

Detect format (JSON/NDJSON/text); optional Grok patterns

Normalize record: {ts, level, service, message, kv…}

Chunk by time or tokens (e.g., 2–5 min or ≤6k tokens)

Anomaly Detection (MVP)

Sliding window stats on level=ERROR, latency buckets, or custom counters

Z-score or EWM baseline; flag spikes/outliers

Summarization

Prompt includes: org context, source metadata, time window, top patterns, anomalies

Output: title, severity, bullets (3–7), evidence (top lines), next_steps

Cost Controls

Token-aware batching, top-K selection of representative lines

Cache identical prompts across tenants (hash of content window)

Fallback to local model for large batches / non-urgent jobs

6) Alerts & Dedup

AlertRule.condition: JSON logic like:

{ "metric":"error_rate", "op":">", "threshold":0.02, "window":"5m", "service":"api" }


channels: { "slack":["https://hooks..."], "email":["oncall@example.com"] }

Dedup key: org_id + rule_id + normalized_title

Throttle: resend after cool-down; escalate on frequency

7) Security & Compliance (MVP)

TLS everywhere; HSTS

Tokens: JWT with org_id, roles, expiry; rotate signing keys

Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager; KMS CMKs for S3, RDS

PII scrubber before LLM calls (emails, IPs, tokens, secrets)

Data retention per plan; hard delete on org deletion

Rate limiting per endpoint (per user, per API key)

8) Deployment Topology (AWS)

ECS Fargate Services:

api-service ([C4]) behind ALB

worker-service ([C5]) consumers of SQS

ai-service ([C6]) internal (optionally combine with workers for MVP)

RDS Postgres (multi-AZ), S3 (versioning + lifecycle), SQS

CloudFront → static assets + HTTPS

SES for email; Slack webhooks for Slack

Terraform for IaC; GitHub Actions for CI/CD

9) Quotas & Plans (enforced in API + workers)

Free: 50 MB/month, 1 source, 7-day retention

Starter: 5 GB/month, 3 sources, 30-day retention

Team: 50 GB/month, 10 sources, 90-day retention

Hard stops + friendly errors + upgrade path

10) Failure Modes & Mitigations

Large file → stream to S3; chunk server-side; backpressure on queue depth

LLM outage → retry with jitter; fallback to cached or local model; mark summary as partial

S3 eventual consistency → head-object retry

Hot tenants → per-org concurrency caps; fair-queueing by org_id

Schema changes → migration gating; versioned prompts and output

11) Non-Functional Targets (MVP)

P95 upload registration < 300 ms

P95 dashboard queries < 500 ms for 24h window

Process 1 GB log upload to first summary < 5–8 min (cost-aware)

≥99.9% API availability

12) Left-to-Right Sequence Scenarios

A) File Upload → Summary → Alert

User opens Dashboard [C8], gets JWT from [C3]

Calls POST /v1/logs/upload-url on [C4]; receives pre-signed S3 URL [S1]

PUT file → S3 [S1]

POST /v1/logs/register-upload → row in upload, push SQS job [Q1]

Worker [C5] pulls job, reads S3, parses, chunks, computes stats

Sends contextual prompt to [C6], receives summary

Persists summary + anomaly rows to [S2]

Evaluates alert_rule; if triggered → [C7] sends Slack/Email

Dashboard fetches summaries/anomalies via [C4] and renders

B) Streaming Logs (short bursts)

Agent/CLI POST /v1/logs/stream with NDJSON lines → [C4]

[C4] buffers lines to short window, writes to S3 (append object) & SQS notify

Worker handles as above, but in smaller, near-real-time windows

13) Minimal Schemas (examples)

/v1/logs/register-upload (req)

{ "object_key":"org123/sourceA/2025-09-23/upload-abc.gz", "size": 7340032, "hash":"sha256:...", "source_id":"src_abc123" }


Summary record (persisted)

{
  "id":"sum_01",
  "org_id":"org123",
  "source_id":"src_abc123",
  "chunk_id":"chk_09",
  "severity":"high",
  "title":"Spike in 5xx after deploy v2.1.3",
  "bullets":[
    "Error rate rose from 0.3% → 7% within 4 min",
    "Top error: DynamoDB timeout (ReadCapacityExceeded)",
    "First occurrence at 14:02:11Z, correlated with image sha256:…"
  ],
  "llm_model":"gpt-4.1-mini",
  "cost_usd":0.014,
  "created_at":"2025-09-23T12:17:52Z"
}

14) Implementation Notes (for the team)

Chunk size: aim for ≤ 6k tokens per LLM call; overlap windows by 10–15% to avoid boundary loss.

Time indexing: store ts_start/ts_end at both upload and chunk for efficient range queries.

Search: start with Postgres GIN on ts and service; add pgvector later if needed.

Testing: golden logs corpus + snapshot tests for summaries; fuzz PII scrubber.

LLM prompts: version them; persist prompt_version with every summary for traceability.

If you want, I can also generate:

a Terraform module skeleton for the AWS pieces (S3/SQS/RDS/ECS),

or a FastAPI route map with stub handlers you can hand to Copilot for code-gen.
